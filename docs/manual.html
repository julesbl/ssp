<h2><a name="introduction" id="introduction" />Introduction</h2>
<p>The objective of these routines and packages is to provide good site
security for php dynamic web sites which is easily configurable by any
competent programmer.</p>
<p>While coding membership sites and other applications needing
password protection I tried a number libraries and found that they
either did not provide very good protection, were complicated to set
up, badly documented or all three.</p>
<p>I have been coding this project with the following objectives:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>Easy to configure.</li>
  <li>Covers the most usual login setups.</li>
  <li>Variable levels of security depending on need.</li>
  <li>Capable of using SSL either just for the login or for the whole site.</li>
  <li> Good basic user admin.</li>
  <li>Easy to include into the dynamic pages of the site.</li>
  <li> High level of security without having to try too hard.</li>
  <li>Good documentation to help with all the jargon and concepts.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="require" id="require" />Requirements</h2>
<p>The routines are designed to work with the following system components:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>PHP v5.0 or greater.</li><li>Any database supported by ADODB.</li>
  <li>Any web server.</li>
  <li>Shared hosting or better. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="overview" id="overview" />Overview</h2>
<p>SSP consists of a set of libraries to implement the session
handling, logon, user routines etc. and a set of applications to
generate logon screens, user admin etc. Certain libraries and routines
are designed to be modified to get the required user functionality and
to match the site look and feel, others should not be touched to allow
easy bug fixes and upgrades.</p>
<h3>Libraries &amp; Config</h3>
<p>All libraries and configuration files are stored in the includes
directory, this should be, if possible, placed outside the viewable
area of the web site (see <a href="#config">Configuration</a>). </p>

<h2><a name="config" id="config" />Configuration</h2>
<p>Configuration of the package is as follows (see the relevent sections for more detail):-</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose where to put the include and admin directories.</li>
  <li>Create an empty database or check the table names do not conflict on an exisiting database.</li>
  <li>Set up the paths in includes/include.php, includes/config.php and admin/includeheader.php.</li>
  <li>Set up the database config in includes/config.php and whether you are going to use ssl etc.</li>
  <li>Upload the includes and admin directories to their chosen locations.</li>
  <li>Point a browser at admin/dbsetup.php to create the database, on succesful operation delete this file. </li>
  <li>Modify
testing.php to so that it loads include.php at the top, put it in the
main body of your site and point to it with a browser.</li>
  <li>Hopefully
you should get a logon page which you will be able to logon with either
username: admin or email: admin@admin.com with the password admin, the
test page will then be displayed.</li>
  <li> Once the system is
working you can add fields to SSP_UserMisc to store the data you want
on the users and then modify the functions in userclasses.php to change
the join up and user admin screens.</li>
  <li>If you need to add increased functionality for the joining script modify usercreation.php.</li>
  <li>To change the look of the applications to match your site modify the .tpl files.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Location of includes &amp; admin Directories</h3>
<p>The includes and admin directories can be re-named if they clash with something else.</p>
<p>The includes should, if possible, be located outside the area
viewable by a browser eg. if you need to put your files in a directory
called public or public_html or some such to be viewable by a browser
the includes directory should not be under this directory but at the
same level, this helps stop hackers compromising your system.</p>
<p>Directory admin should be in a browser viewable location since it
has applications which execute when a browser is pointed at them.</p>
<h3>Database tables</h3>
<p>All the database tables are pre-pended by SSP_ to prevent clashes if
you are using a single database for all your database operations, it
would be better to create a seperate database for this application if
your hosting allows you.</p>
<p>You can rename the tables simply by modifying their names in the
config.php before your run dbsetup.php, or after by renaming the tables
in the database using your admin tools or the database command line.</p>
<p>To configure the type of database being used change the $dsn string
in config.php, see the documentation for the PEAR -&gt; DATABASE -&gt;
DB package at <a href="http://pear.php.net/" target="_blank">http://pear.php.net/</a></p>
<h3>Setting Paths</h3>
<p>Getting the paths right for the includes and admin directories is
very important, you must not use relative paths, e.g. ../../includes/,
since this could cause problems depending on where the page you are
protecting is located, use absolute paths from the top level of the
server ie. they should start with something like /usr/local/http/ etc.
or, in the case of the path to the admin directory, should start with
the url e.g. www.mysite.com/admin .</p>
<p>Finding the absolute path for your domain can be tricky, most
hosting companies do not tell you. The best way I have found is to
create a simple PHP script that includes another one which does not
exist and you will usually get an error message similar to this:</p>
<p> <b>Warning</b>: main(test2): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in <b>/usr/local/home/httpd/vhtdocs/w34u.com/public/SSP/admin/test.php</b> on line <b>39</b><br />
  <br />
  <b>Warning</b>: main(): Failed opening 'test2' for inclusion (include_path='.:/opt/php-4.3/lib/php') in <b>/usr/local/home/httpd/vhtdocs/w34u.com/public/SSP/admin/test.php</b> on line <b>39</b> </p>
<p>Now I know that my browsable area is in the public directory so if I
put my includes directory at the same level, thus making it invisible
to browsers, its path will be:</p>
<p><b>/usr/local/home/httpd/vhtdocs/w34u.com/includes/</b></p>
<p>So I can set $SSP_IncludePath in includes/include.php to this and the path for path for admin/includehearder.php will be:</p>
<p><strong>/usr/local/home/httpd/vhtdocs/w34u.com/public/SSP/includes/include.php</strong></p>
<p>The path for the admin directory in includes/config.php would be www.w34u.com/SSP/admin/ .</p>
<h3>Setting up config.php</h3>
<p>The config.php file in includes has already been mentioned several
times now, this section covers what the various sections configure.</p>
<p>The file defines a class called SSP_Configuration, this is
instanciated as a global object called SSP_Config which is used by all
the routines to run the system. Also in the file is all the PHP system
session variables that can be modified by the user so the whole system
can be configured from this one location. </p>
<h4>PHP error handling</h4>
<p>Once you have your application running without any bugs comment out these two lines.</p>
<h4>Database Configuration</h4>
<p>Set up the PEAR DB dsn used to connect to the database, see the PEAR DB documentation at <a href="http://pear.php.net">pear.php.net</a>, sets up the names of the tables used by SSP.</p>
<h4>General SSP Configuration</h4>
<p>Defines where the admin directory is located, the names of the
various applications, url for the home page for the site and location
of a temporary directory for general file handling.</p>
<p>The constructor creates full paths from this information. If $useSSL is true the paths start with https:// else http://, see <a href="#security">Internet Security</a> for more detail.</p>
<p>A problem with the complete paths sometimes is that
$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] returns the domain name with no "www." at the
beginning, if the site has been entered with the "www." on the
beginning, it can cause the session to be re-started anew on logon and
cause a continuity failure. If $adminDir starts with "www." this will
always be added to the history for what page has been logged onto and
any scripts that generate their own paths for refering to themselves.</p></body></html>
