<h1>SSP Quick Start Guide</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This guide is aimed at people with a good level of php
knowlege and some idea of how to install applications on shared hosts.</p>
<p>The objective of these routines is to supply a secure login system
to be wrapped round applications and websites so that developers do not
need to write their own.</p>
<p>These libraries have been hardened against sql injection, javascript
injection, cookie and session theft and cross site scripting. The best
protection will occure if the login form and the session and random
cookies all use ssl, this will take the purchase of a certificate from
the likes of verizone and configuration of the hosting to use https://.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>These routines need at least php version 4.1, preferably 4.3 for
improved security. If you are using PEAR the latest updates need to be
installed.</p>
<p>Works with MySql and MS Sql Server, nearly working on Posgre Sql. </p>
<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>The routines can use either one of two sets of data abstraction libraries.</p>
<h3>AdoDb</h3>
<p>The libraries are configured to use this by default and they are included in the distribution in /sspincludes/adodb/.</p>
<p>See&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://adodb.sourceforge.net/">adodb.sourceforge.net/</a> for full documentation. </p><h2>Directories</h2>
<p>Place the directory sspadmin in the browser visible part of
your hosting so that the applications there can be executed using the
browser.</p>
<p>Place the sspincludes directory, if possible, outside the
browser viewable area.</p>
<h2>Database</h2>
<p>Using either the commend line or your favourite database
administration tool execute the SSP_Database.sql file stored in the
database directory to create the database.</p>
<p>Another way is to execute dbsetup.php in sspadmin/setup once
you have got the include paths and the database dsn correct.</p>
<p>There is also a dbsetupMSSQL.php for Microsft sequel server
installations.</p>
<h2>Include Paths</h2>
<h3>Finding my absolute paths</h3>
<p>To find
where the domain directory is located can be tough, the easiest way I
have found is to create a php file with an incorrect include and the
error reply should give you the absolute path to the web viewable
directory, the non viewable area is usually in the directory above this
and is usually where the ftp base directory is located for your login.</p>
<p>There
are exceptions to that such as pear where the non web visible area is
in a totally different directory and is connected to the viewable area
by a link, the paths required for these hostings will either be in the
ftp package path at the top or findable in the hosting firms
documentation.</p>
<h2>Modify the includeheader.change.php</h2>
<p>Rename to includeheader.php</p>
<p>There are two options for the include paths, the development server
and the live server, if you only have a live server just change the
second set of paths or make them both the same. </p>
<p>Set $SSP_RootPath to the domain directory eg.
  /user/www/domainName/<br />
Set $SSP_IncludePath to eg. $SSP_RootPath . "pathtoinclude/sspincludes"</p>
<h2>Modify config.change.php</h2>
<p>Rename to config.php </p>
<p>Go through config.php modifying the configuration as needed.</p>
<p>Primary importance is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The database DSN, see <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php" target="_blank">http://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php</a>
for full details.</li>
<li>The domain setups, use .domain.com or whatever, the period
at the
start will mean it works with www.domain.com or something.domain.com or
domain.com.</li>
<li>The error log file location, preferably outsie the browser
viewable area.</li>
<li>Session and random cookie names.</li>
<li>The random string and encryption strings.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have chosen all the majority of the set ups as you
need upload to the sspinclude directory.</p><h2>Rename userclasses.change.php</h2><p>Rename to userclasses.php . This file is where the developer can override parts of the main classes.</p>
<h2>Database Creation and Initialisation</h2>
<p>Once you have got the include and config files correct point the browser at the correct file in the setup directory in sspadmin.</p>
<p>dbsetup.php - MySql<br />
  dbsetupMSSql.php - MS Sql Server<br />
dbsetupPostgreSql.php - Postgre Sql (experimental)</p>
<p>The basic admin user will be created as explained in the emrgencyadmin create.</p>
<h2>Emrgency Admin Creation  </h2>
<p> Point
you browser at <strong>emergencyadmincreate.php</strong>
in <strong>sspadmin/setup</strong> directory, this will
creat an
admin user with the following details:</p>
<ul>
<li>email: admin@admin.com,</li>
<li>username: admin</li>
<li>password: password100</li>
</ul>
<p>This will only work if there are no admin users defined in the
system.</p>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<p>Navigate to index.php in top level, you should see information
on the session, if you see a require errors check your paths, if you
see database errors check your DSN.</p>
<p><big><big><strong>Delete the setup directory from the server!!!</strong></big></big></p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Simply put:</p>
<p>require(path_to_sspadmin/includeheader.php);<br />
$session = new SSP_Protect("user");</p>
<p>at the top of any php file you wish to protect, the access
can be blank, user or admin or any addtional levels you put in the
config file.</p>
<p>See the examples directory and the manual for more help, the
user admin section is also worth a look.</p>
